# Smart Marriage
Smart Marriage Project

The Smart Marriage Project is built on the awesome work that Jordi did for my wife and I at Burning Man. It is connected to (0wned by) a consensys 2of3 multisig. The marriage contract itself has a few capabilities:

1. Contains the names of the partners in the relationship
2. Contains a short field for vows
3. Has a simple guestbook that allows for donation 

Right now the only way to interact with the contract is the hard way, using MyEtherWallet to send messages and donations to it, and etherscan.io to view the contract contents.

The aim is to make an easy-to-use web interface for the contract that would allow any user to be able to leave messages in the guestbook, donate, or read the contract and guestbook easily, preferably with metamask integration.
